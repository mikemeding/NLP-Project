@Mi2chaelJackson	Celebrities are human infomercials; they are paid millions by companies to endorse wasteful, useless, products.
@Chewydst	Lately, I fall asleep watching Invicta Watch infomercials.... #everynight #neverbuy #onlywatch  #cray
@LukeC2493	Watching the jets and the dolphins slug it out is about as exciting as watching infomercials at 3am while eating cold spaghetti.

@GregStubley3	@Jameschild_ hahaha, well we do have  Coquelin! He's been excellent.
@NYAGAH_	@Andyrees83 Beller√≠n maybe... he played as a LB a few times when he was on loan or we could recall Coquelin,he once played as a makeshift LB
@nurmo16	We need to bring  Francis Coquelin from his loan, well under rated imo.
@LondonsRed	Loans Coquelin out, Now has to play Flamini or Bellerin at LB. What a gamble by Wenger.Ûæå¥Ûæå¥Ûæå¥

@turfpunter	@jmanmetsfan1 I am not sure that Common Core has anything to do with partisanship. The dislike of Common Core is shared by left and right.

@stacEightTweets	Please tell me when our Country has ever had a more divisive President than now. Race, class, gender, & partisanship. #heresyourchange
@simonkinglaw	@ClaireMcWatt and it does seem inevitable that candidates running on non-partisanship inevitably revert to partisanship.

@BaggiesGalore	My starting Xl for tomorrow: Foster, Wisdom, Davidson, Lescott, Dawson, Gardner, Gamboa, Sessegnon, Dorrans, Berahino, Anichebe. #wba
@AdamRitson97	Eat, sleep, victor anichebe, repeat. @TanimHussain
@AGCollins1	@smadeley_star them 3 worked well against United last season.. Arguably Anichebe and sess's best games for us
@Lee_Hickmans	@smadeley_star @KitmanPat I understand him bringing Samaras on (who had a good cameo imo) but it should've been Berahino. Anichebe on his..
@markgrosvenor86	@billhowell68 @HarrySMarch totally agree, anichebe just far more effective off bench. Chronic lack of goals in whole squad bar saido
@markgrosvenor86	@HarrySMarch @billhowell68 just can't see how anichebe can possibly start a match. Good option off bench if needed but that's it for me
@HarrySMarch	@markgrosvenor86 @billhowell68 Surely only one winner in a toss up between Anichebe and Sess!!
@Paul_G_87	On the bench I would have....Myhill, Baird, Wisdom, Blanco, Varela, Samaras, Anichebe #WBA
@russellpinnock2	Imagine being deemed good enough to play in the same side as Ronaldo but not wisdom morrison anichebe etc #varela
@billhowell68	Likely line up tmrrow? Foster, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, Wisdm/Baird; Dorrans, Gardner, Mulumbu, Brunt; Anichebe/Sess, Berahino. #wbafc
@baggiedude54	@WBALatest24 The sub nearly worked with Samaras. NO. Anichebe & Gamboa nearly worked. We could all see what was needed, he did it by mistake

@JFTurpin	@Le_Matheux im not Sure how you can say a soft slow lazy guy like parenteau is beter defensively then weise.....
@_KarateChris	Man timberwolves is bad defensively
@Kileraben	@CrawfordChrisV At least Betts can steal a bunch of bases and potentially be excellent or above defensively in position he settles into
@BKonidis	@JoshuaLee93 this must be painful for you... I'm rooting for em but they just can't get it together. Too many holes defensively
@Le_Matheux	@JFTurpin No, most of it is luck. Parenteau is by far the better puckhandler, and better defensively too.
@UrACone69	Krug isn't producing offensively and is sucking defensively ...
@Katalysteffect	@28Gunny No...I knew he'd leave. Plus he struggles to stay healthy and makes lots of mistakes defensively...So I'm good.
@curryjg44	On a positive note, the #Habs tightened up defensively in the 3rd period. Emelin especially. How many D-men been turned around by Duchene???
@tonyparkszone	Quin, "We had too many breakdowns defensively. We talked  a lot about trust this week. It didn't translate 1st half, then it did in 2nd H
@jar155	@adamhilton Maybe the biggest play of the game defensively aside form the last pick.
@PrincePickaxe	@Andy_Crain The problem is that all three of his power forwards have major flaws defensively. Either can't jump or defend man to man.
@Christrpn	@MikeObrand the thing with DD is that he doesn't offer much defensively, so when he isn't noticeable offensively, we wonder why he's in NHL
@LucasSeehafer	@BreakTheHuddle @DavidEbner Can't argue with that logic, though. His improvement defensively is more important as of now and the long run.
@Kareemerer	@wllmzd May aswell, he's as good defensively as Flamini really.

@jessicaestewart	@sprintcare What can we do to get this all worked out?
@AwkwardAces27	@sprintcare constant problems and expensive service. I will never go back to sprint. T-Mobile screwed me and now you guys are too
@rixon	@sprintcare nvm... finally got the email after about a half hour.  bill paid, crisis/late fee averted.
@jessicaestewart	@sprintcare Then no credit happened. That is essentially stealing $300 from us and saying there is nothing you can do.
@DJDanMichaels	@sprintcare yes...every weekend from 66411.
@jessicaestewart	@sprintcare No, not sure U do. We were lied to - forced to buy things we didn't need but promised equiv. credit.
@MichaelCRoche	@sprintcare thanks!
@_yordnoff	@sprintcare fantastic. I didn't get my phone replaced though. It's ridiculous to go w/o a phone for a week for a warranty replacement

@kusmog	I have @usps packages delivered to my office and they fail to find the place sometimes. So I ship it to my apartment, same fucking shit.
@kusmog	Another @usps delivery, another problem. Tracking says delivered on Sunday, yet I was home on Sunday and Monday... nothing.
@GodsMigraine	.@amazonhelp Handing Prime deliveries over to @USPS for delivery is not a good idea if you want to accomplish a 2 day delivery.
@Astucks	Dear @USPS you said my package was delivered and it wasn't. üò¢ I cry
@Jimmyf29	@USPS today waiting for my package i once again read that a delivery was "attempted" it's happened to me so many times. I am upset. again
@MsAtomicBomb18	Just tracked a package with @USPS it says it's out for delivery 12/1. Um yea it's 11:30 EST I don't think it's being delivered today?
@tsegreto	Can someone explain to me why the @USPS still exists? Private companies such as @UPS and @FedEx are more effective at a lower cost.

@P6teenDaKing	Huddlestone: "Modric's just ice cold & calm under pressure - he manages to get out of any situation & keep the ball.""
@P6teenDaKing	Huddlestone: "The way Modric manipulated the ball & his first touch - whatever situation he was in - was unbelievable.""
@P6teenDaKing	Huddlestone: "Modric's actually good with both feet, although back then [at #THFC] he tended to use his right a lot more.""
@P6teenDaKing	Tom Huddlestone: "The main difference between Luka & most other players is his ability to pass the ball with the outside of the boot.""
