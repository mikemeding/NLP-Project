@joecommon	@capehartj repubs are mostly racists who do not want non whites living in America. Their lies & powergrabs are an attempt to make it happen
@rperschmann	@memelas4U @AveAmerGirl @RomyUSA @pedocles @BarackObama @SpeakerBoehner Precisely! Repubs R enemy saboteurs. 2many Dems R careerist cowards.
@StevenPatton	@jahshu @mrmedina but I'm not gonna go on to explain why this is a good idea. Even ultra conservative repubs say this is good.
@miltonazous	@AlanEggleston Good article. No need for third party if dems can get good people. Repubs keep getting worse.

@GregStubley3	@Jameschild_ hahaha, well we do have  Coquelin! He's been excellent.
@NYAGAH_	@Andyrees83 Bellerín maybe... he played as a LB a few times when he was on loan or we could recall Coquelin,he once played as a makeshift LB
@nurmo16	We need to bring  Francis Coquelin from his loan, well under rated imo.
@LondonsRed	Loans Coquelin out, Now has to play Flamini or Bellerin at LB. What a gamble by Wenger.󾌴󾌴󾌴

@Eventzon	@mbtaGM Using the Dan Grabowski firm if scheduling? Remove trains unannounced, cancel service for no reason. Treat public with contempt?
@Eventzon	@mbtaGM @ 6:18 pm there were 3 north trains to 1 south. Nxt train in 3 min, after that 20 min. When did 6:18 exit rush hour?
@Eventzon	@mbtaGM Once again T mgmt displays its contempt. When will T mgnt stop acting as though riders are a necessary evil for keeping their jobs?
@Eventzon	@mbtaGM Lousy service and not even a cold day. Why? Why what probably totaled a 15 min wait at Haymarket during rush hour?
@Eventzon	@mbtaGM such as timely trains & safety in trains but plenty $ spent on pretend security. & the 9 min train wait changed to 8 min 5 min later
@Eventzon	@mbtaGM wielding rider the other day. Meanwhile Haymarkwt platform. Is already filling up. Summary: money not spent where neesee
@Eventzon	@mbtaGM Nxt south train on O line @ Hay market is 9 min. Upstairs is an episode of security theater which didn't protect ounkuc from knife

@turfpunter	@jmanmetsfan1 I am not sure that Common Core has anything to do with partisanship. The dislike of Common Core is shared by left and right.

@JoeBOBaHead	Wow. @TheDailyShow isn't even trying to hide their partisanship with the latest episode.
@ThatChance	@NYCFCWatch Also admit I don't understand the bitter, nasty partisanship some feel. Love to see the game flourish in NYC. Even minor league.

@stacEightTweets	Please tell me when our Country has ever had a more divisive President than now. Race, class, gender, & partisanship. #heresyourchange
@simonkinglaw	@ClaireMcWatt and it does seem inevitable that candidates running on non-partisanship inevitably revert to partisanship.
@gwynskid	@mjblair He had an opportunity to send a major signal re: unity, non-partisanship. Totally blew it.

@BaggiesGalore	My starting Xl for tomorrow: Foster, Wisdom, Davidson, Lescott, Dawson, Gardner, Gamboa, Sessegnon, Dorrans, Berahino, Anichebe. #wba
@AdamRitson97	Eat, sleep, victor anichebe, repeat. @TanimHussain
@AGCollins1	@smadeley_star them 3 worked well against United last season.. Arguably Anichebe and sess's best games for us
@Lee_Hickmans	@smadeley_star @KitmanPat I understand him bringing Samaras on (who had a good cameo imo) but it should've been Berahino. Anichebe on his..
@markgrosvenor86	@billhowell68 @HarrySMarch totally agree, anichebe just far more effective off bench. Chronic lack of goals in whole squad bar saido
@markgrosvenor86	@HarrySMarch @billhowell68 just can't see how anichebe can possibly start a match. Good option off bench if needed but that's it for me
@HarrySMarch	@markgrosvenor86 @billhowell68 Surely only one winner in a toss up between Anichebe and Sess!!
@Paul_G_87	On the bench I would have....Myhill, Baird, Wisdom, Blanco, Varela, Samaras, Anichebe #WBA
@russellpinnock2	Imagine being deemed good enough to play in the same side as Ronaldo but not wisdom morrison anichebe etc #varela
@billhowell68	Likely line up tmrrow? Foster, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, Wisdm/Baird; Dorrans, Gardner, Mulumbu, Brunt; Anichebe/Sess, Berahino. #wbafc
@baggiedude54	@WBALatest24 The sub nearly worked with Samaras. NO. Anichebe & Gamboa nearly worked. We could all see what was needed, he did it by mistake

@JivinGgirl	@kerrywashington @BarackObama yeah-pay hundreds of dollars a month for premiums then thousands for deductibles and STILL pay out of pocket
@hughhewitt	@CarolFoster13 It is crazy for GOP members to vote to cut military benefits, increase TriCare deductibles. They should, refuse to pass NDAA
@joehilley	@businessinsider Premiums are too high for ACA deductibles - forces some to choose between insurance they can't use and medicine they need
@LisaGayle8	@nprnews and what kind of insurance coverage and how much, too.  People with high deductibles may not even visit the doctor until too late
@MicheleLevani	All I dream about are copays and deductibles lately... 󾭙󾌡
@AdamD_92	@SpeakerBoehner I just paid $3200 in deductibles that I didn't  used to pay last year. Sorry to bother you.
@confusedabout	@Citizen401 it's the deductibles. I'd say 35% of the orders for x rays, CT's, or MRI's don't happen because they can pay the deductible. 1/2

@JFTurpin	@Le_Matheux im not Sure how you can say a soft slow lazy guy like parenteau is beter defensively then weise.....
@_KarateChris	Man timberwolves is bad defensively
@Kileraben	@CrawfordChrisV At least Betts can steal a bunch of bases and potentially be excellent or above defensively in position he settles into
@BKonidis	@JoshuaLee93 this must be painful for you... I'm rooting for em but they just can't get it together. Too many holes defensively
@Le_Matheux	@JFTurpin No, most of it is luck. Parenteau is by far the better puckhandler, and better defensively too.
@UrACone69	Krug isn't producing offensively and is sucking defensively ...
@Katalysteffect	@28Gunny No...I knew he'd leave. Plus he struggles to stay healthy and makes lots of mistakes defensively...So I'm good.
@curryjg44	On a positive note, the #Habs tightened up defensively in the 3rd period. Emelin especially. How many D-men been turned around by Duchene???
@tonyparkszone	Quin, "We had too many breakdowns defensively. We talked  a lot about trust this week. It didn't translate 1st half, then it did in 2nd H
@jar155	@adamhilton Maybe the biggest play of the game defensively aside form the last pick.
@PrincePickaxe	@Andy_Crain The problem is that all three of his power forwards have major flaws defensively. Either can't jump or defend man to man.
@Christrpn	@MikeObrand the thing with DD is that he doesn't offer much defensively, so when he isn't noticeable offensively, we wonder why he's in NHL
@LucasSeehafer	@BreakTheHuddle @DavidEbner Can't argue with that logic, though. His improvement defensively is more important as of now and the long run.
@Kareemerer	@wllmzd May aswell, he's as good defensively as Flamini really.
@thelonghorns12	Watching the replay of this Texas vs UCONN game, we make very few mistakes defensively.

@jessicaestewart	@sprintcare What can we do to get this all worked out?
@AwkwardAces27	@sprintcare constant problems and expensive service. I will never go back to sprint. T-Mobile screwed me and now you guys are too
@rixon	@sprintcare nvm... finally got the email after about a half hour.  bill paid, crisis/late fee averted.
@jessicaestewart	@sprintcare Then no credit happened. That is essentially stealing $300 from us and saying there is nothing you can do.
@DJDanMichaels	@sprintcare yes...every weekend from 66411.
@jessicaestewart	@sprintcare No, not sure U do. We were lied to - forced to buy things we didn't need but promised equiv. credit.
@MichaelCRoche	@sprintcare thanks!
@_yordnoff	@sprintcare fantastic. I didn't get my phone replaced though. It's ridiculous to go w/o a phone for a week for a warranty replacement

@tsegreto	Can someone explain to me why the @USPS still exists? Private companies such as @UPS and @FedEx are more effective at a lower cost.
@jxrlee	Can a @USPS package be 'delivered' without the 'out for delivery' status? Definitely didn't get my package... http://t.co/BS6Nxt5gR0

@IzzyChao	keats needs to straight up chill w the imagery some times
@IzzyChao	it probably wont be super hard to annotate though bc i can just be like IMAGERY!!!!  ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! !! and be almost totally done
@meatylegmonstrr	Imagery coming out of this is amazing. Heart breaking, but amazing.
@direhellswan	@crownofbirds Definitely better imagery than the ragged hole I'd always felt in my chest, back in the bad days. Much more hopeful, for one.

@godeatings	@sophmoredisease Undertaker?
@tcbinla	@144captain No BS! @steveaustinBSR asked about CM Punk, Where's Shane, JR's release, Macho Man HOF, Undertaker losing WM 30. It was good!

@BrittanyTessmer	Mark Twain~ Let us so live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.
